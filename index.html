    <h2>About Simlify</h2>
    <p>
      Simlify is an app that teaches Simlish using spaced repetition. Simlish is a fictional language featured in
      <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/pc/features/overview">The Sims</a>, a video-game franchise by EA Games.
    </p>
      <h2>What is spaced repetition?</h2>
      <p>
        Spaced repetition is learning technique; Every day, you will review new, learned, and unlearned words in Simlify. Over time, words you've learned will appear less often and words you're still learning will appear more often. For now, our app will feature 10 words from the Simlish language.
